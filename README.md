# Color Identification

## Identify the colors of an image and their position, using Python 

In this repository you will find the script to identify the colors of your image and its specific slice. 
The theoretical background and principles of this work can be found here:

An example of the code is the following one
```python
python ColorFinder.py --image_path [path_of_your_image] --color [color_string] --color_number [chosen_color_number]
```

And it selects all the squares where the color is dominant wrt the others. 
An example of the code is reported in __results.txt__ , while in __ColorIdentificationUsingML.ipynb__ additional features can be found. 

Happy Rainbow! :)
